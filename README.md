# Introduction
LedBox V2 / V2.1 is a fully contained, sound reactive, ESP32 based module for controlling 5-12V addressable LED strips (WS281x, SK6812, etc.), supporting both 3-(VDD,DAT,GND) and 4-(VDD,DAT,CLK,GND) wire configuration.

The module (V2 & V2.1) has a dedicated step-down converter, which allows to seamlessly use both 5V and 12V strips (input voltage has to match strip's voltage). It also contains a digital MEMS microphone, side button, 32kHz IR receiver, 10A safety resettable fuse, 1000µF buffer capacitor, 3.3V/5V level converter for both Data and Clock lines, together with an impedance matching resistor. These features ensure maximum functionality, safety, and led strip compatibility, all in a small 3D printable enclosure.

LedBox V2.1 has these additional features:

-   MOSFET that automatically disconnects the LED strip power when in standby
-   Potentiometer for precise impedance matching
-   3 unallocated GPIO pins for possible expansion

Purchased module comes with the latest version of sound-reactive firmware.

## Firmware versions
The original precompiled SR WLED firmware has a disabled IR control. Therefore, it is recommended to use builds from this repo, which are compiled with correct pin/microphone settings and IR control support, to work with the module straight out of the box.

The firmware is compatible with both, V2 and V2.1.
